(Website under construction)

I am Viviana Romero Alarcon, a computational biologist from Colombia and a current PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My primary research is to leverage the power of AI to improve reproducibility and replicability in phylogenetic comparative biology. Also, I am interested in the relation between extinction risk, body mass evolution, and extinction selectivity. I am passionate about modeling, programming, and phylogenies <3
