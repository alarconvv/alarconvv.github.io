## Hello there!
I am Viviana Romero Alarcon, a computational biologist from Colombia and a current PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My primary research is to leverage the power of AI to improve reproducibility and replicability in phylogenetic comparative biology. In addition, I am using deep learning to resolve empirical questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. I am passionate about modeling, programming, and phylogenies <3
