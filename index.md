## Hello there!

  <div style="flex: 50%; padding-right: 20px;">
 
I am Viviana Romero Alarcon, a computational biologist from Colombia and a current PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. My primary research is to leverage the power of AI to improve reproducibility and replicability in phylogenetic comparative biology. Also, I am interested in the relation between extinction risk, body mass evolution, and extinction selectivity. I am passionate about modeling, programming, and phylogenies <3
