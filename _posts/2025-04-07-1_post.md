## Hi! There!

To be honest, I do not know how to run a blog or what to write here for the first time. I am not a person who loves writing (especially in a language that is not my mother tongue). However, I am the kind of person who enjoys sharing stories, learning new things (Thanks ADD), and particularly teaching.

Yes, I like teaching, but not for the reasons you are thinking. I do not feel it is my vocation. Indeed, I admire people who love teaching and can cope with stress levels that I could not. For me, teaching has been the way I learned to learn, and it is my approach to learning something. Then, it's a win-win! I learn, and somebody learns too!

Considering my quals are coming in August, I just want to follow my favorite scientist's (Richard Feynman) words:  
> *"If you want to master something, teach it."*  
...and that is the purpose of this new chapter in my life: a blog I hope to maintain during my career as a scientist—and to help me pass my exams!

## ![📎](images/clipboard-3930698824.png) Who am I? Because there is a person behind this work

My name is **Leidy Viviana Romero Alarcon**; everybody calls me Viviana—except my family. For a while, I hated *Leidy* because it’s a poor spelling of *Lady* in English. However, I made peace with my first name after discovering **Joseph Leidy**, one of the most prolific paleontologists and anatomists of the 19th century.

That fact helps me tolerate “Leidy” because I love paleontology and vertebrate comparative anatomy. So, call me whatever you’d like — random fact, right?

I’m from Bucaramanga, a small city in Colombia. My education has been 100% public — from elementary school to my PhD (and I’m so proud of that). It hasn't been easy, but here I am, against all probabilities.

Now, I’m a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Boston. This university — and my PI — gave me the most important opportunity of my life, something I’ll always be grateful for.

Yes, I finally overcame my fear of speaking English. I finally asked for a coffee without freezing up! 😅 I’m now in my second year — ups and downs, but overall successful.

I don’t know yet what my dissertation will be. There are so many wonderful questions, and not enough time. Right now, I’m focused on preparing for quals and optimizing my life. **Time** is my biggest constraint.

## 📝 To Practice Writing

English is not my first language, and the first part of my quals is a written exam. No internet, no corrector — just me and a basic text editor. Nightmare.

So, I want to get comfortable writing, expressing complex ideas clearly and naturally. I hope that by writing regularly in a low-pressure space like this blog, I’ll improve (and pass my exam!).

## 🎯 To Stay Focused and Accountable

It’s a mental need to organize my thoughts and track my learning. If I can explain it clearly, I probably understand it. (Or so I hope.)

## 🔍 To Make the Process Transparent

Some of my study material is about reproducibility in science.  
[@danielhaehn](https://github.com/danielhaehn), author of *The Seven Levels of Open Science*, argues that we should share our process from the beginning — and that’s what I’m trying to do.

Although this blog isn’t the start of my research, it may lead to new ideas that grow into real PhD research.

Also, quals prep is overwhelming. Maybe this blog will help someone else in the same situation — or at least spark a conversation.

## 💡 To Build a Habit

A critical skill in science is **WRITING**.

I used to think writing came easier for some people. But after reading countless "How to write better" books, articles, and podcasts, they all say the same thing:

> *"If you want to master writing, you have to write."*

I didn’t understand that until I realized I had a written exam with no safety nets. It won’t matter how many videos I’ve watched or books I’ve read — if I haven’t written, I’m not ready.

I remember walking into my PI’s office and saying,  
> *“I need to learn how to write.”*

He just said,  
> *“Then you should write.”*

I walked out disappointed. But now, writing this, I get it.

So, this is my commitment — to build better habits. Not just for quals, but for my life as a researcher.

## 🧠 In Summary

I'll be posting:
- Summaries of what I study
- Notes on tricky concepts
- Reflections on readings (like *Phylogenetics, Evolution, Code, and Deep Learning*)
- And anything else I discover along the way.

Thanks for reading! 🌱  
Let’s see where this goes.
